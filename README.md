# tigerhacks
Hello! Welcome to ParkPal!

This is our project that we have created for the Mizzou Tigerhacks 2022 Event.

Within this project we utilized multiple different programming languages
to create a website that allowes users to find good parking spots 
in downtown Columbia Missouri!. This years theme was "Transportation"
therefor we felt like this was the perfect idea for the cause.
