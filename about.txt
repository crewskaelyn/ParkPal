            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>The program that is hosted on this website holds has one main purpose. To make parking easier for those in Columbia.
                It provides statistics on which parking lots are the least full, allows the user to input which parking lot they are
                parking in and for how long, allows them to rate how full they believe the lot is, and provides a forum for users to
                give feedback on what is happining downtown.</p>

            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <h4>Logan Limbaugh</h4>
            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Missouri in pursuit of a Bachelor's in Information Technology. I plan to work in 
                cybersecurity for the government when I leave college. For this project, I worked on developing the program hosted on 
                the website using C#. </p>
            <p>I come from a small town in southeast Missouri with a population of about 2,000. I was fortunate enough to be able to 
                attend Mizzou through scholarships and grants. I am a first generation student, so not only has this been a new
                experience for me, but also for my family. 
            </p>
            <h4>Kaelyn Crews</h4>
            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Missouri in pursuit of a Bachelor's in Information Technology and a minor in
                Psychology. I plan to work in either Software Development or Web Development. For this project, I created the website,
                using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. </p>
            <p>I am from a town just 40 minutes from Columbia with a population of only 250. My graduating class was only 16, and I was
                one of only a couple who are attending a university.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why We Made It</h3>
            <p>For the past 36 hours, the both of us have been programming this website and the program that resides on it. This
                weekend was the University of Missouri's Hackathon, also known as TigerHacks. The theme this year was Transportation.
                With both of us living in Columbia, we have been faced with the difficulties of parking downtown time and time again.
                Since we both come from small towns, driving and parking anxiety is a constant struggle.When we found out about this
                year's theme, we both knew exactly what we wanted to do. </p>
